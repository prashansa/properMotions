The project is aimed at 
  1. creating a catalog of stars and their corresponding proper motions
  2. once we know these, we can move on to do some more interesting science like analysis of kinematics of stars, their streams etc!

In order to do the first part, we use data form various surveys beginning with PAN-STARRS, SDSS, POSS. 
  - All these surveys have data on stars and galaxies taken over some period of time. 
  - We cross-calibrate them and calculate proper motion
